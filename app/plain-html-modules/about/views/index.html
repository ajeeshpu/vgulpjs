            <h2>Why drinkers love Vgulp</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>	Simply put, more options – Instead of giving you discounts in places you never want to go to, which are 10 – 15 kms from your work / home, we negotiate deals in your neighborhood and provide you more options. When you get access to Vgulp, probably you will be surprised to find the same bars / pubs / liquor stores that you frequent welcome you with a deal. We have more deals in bars today, as compared to any other portal and the future is bright.</p></li>
                <li><p>We don’t spam you with Daily Deals – We personally opted out of the various daily deals newsletters. Currently there is just one newsletter on Friday – “F for Freakin Awesome Fridays”, and occasional updates about how we are going forward.</p></li>
                <li><p>No Crap Strategy – We will not put a single deal on Vgulp, that we personally wouldn’t claim. Vgulp was born out of a requirement to solve a pain we had, and we will continue to do so.</p></li>
                <li><p>No payments on the site – We believe payments cannot out perform convenience. We would not charge you a dime for claiming a deal on our site, neither would we ask you to print coupons.</p></li>
