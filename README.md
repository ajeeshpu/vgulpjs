vgulpjs
=======

Vgulp website on github

This is an attempt to do the current vgulp.com as jsTemplates.
It is currently not optimized, however there are future plans (very very soon) to support it. The rendering is slow due 
to the async RequireJS dependencies being loaded. 

Hoping for the web to be a lot better without buying hosting.
I know i could have made this into a single page app but there are future plans to accomodate snapshoting for Google SEO.
( This is not reason enough for the '#' urls but i preferred this way as this took very little time)

This site was generated using a self woven CMS written in node.

Long live JS, Knockout, RequireJS, Hogan. !
