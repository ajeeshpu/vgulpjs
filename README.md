vgulpjs
=======

Vgulp website on github

This is an attempt to do the current vgulp.com as jsTemplates.
It is currently not optimized, however there are future plans (very very soon) to support it. The rendering is slow due 
to the async RequireJS dependencies being loaded. 

Hoping for the web to be a lot better without buying hosting.
Moving to Durandal , this was a lot easier (should have done this earlier).

This site was generated using a self woven CMS written in node.
